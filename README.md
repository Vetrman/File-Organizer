This ridiculously simple program, as it turned out, was needed by some people at my workplace who don't know how to handle files and their extensions. So, this "marvel" was created. Basically, if someone who doesn't have a clue wants to change a file extension, they take the path, then the file itself, then select a new extension, and save it. Don't ask who it's for â€“ such people actually exist!
